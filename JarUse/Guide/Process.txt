I prepare a hello-jar to demonstrate how to use external .jar file.
This jar library include a class 'Jar'.
It has a method named 'getStringFromJar()' will return a String "Hello world From JAR !".

 1. Put .jar to '<project>/app/libs'.
 2. Right click it and hit 'Add as Library'.
 3. Ensure that 'compile files('libs/hello-jar.jar')' is in your build.gradle(app).
 4. Do a clean build.
 5. To see ApplicationTest where function 'testUseJar()' show the result.
