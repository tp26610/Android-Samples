1. Configurate build.gradle for build .jar.
    (1) replace :
        apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
        to :
        apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

    (2) delete following elements in defaultConfig block:
        applicationId ...
        versionCode ...
        versionName ...

    (3) add following code to build.gradle :

        task clearJar(type: Delete) {
            delete 'build/outputs/yourname.jar'
        }

        task makeJar(type: Copy) {
            from('build/intermediates/bundles/release/')
            into('build/outputs/')
            include('classes.jar')
            rename ('classes.jar', 'yourname.jar')
        }

        makeJar.dependsOn(clearJar, build)

    (4) Use Terminal to make jar file:
        cd <project>
        gradlew makeJar

        While executing gradlew at first time, you will start downloading some files.
        After that, please execute 'gradlew makeJar' again.

    (5) You will see the 'yourname.jar' in '<project>/app/build/outputs'.
        Open it with zip and delete the unrelational .class files.
